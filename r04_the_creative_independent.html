              <p><strong>Graphic designer Br√°ulio Amado on throwing what you've learned out the window</strong>
              </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Epiphanies/Insights: </strong> The Internet is really full of possibilies. Soda said Went to internet to find place where she belonged, 
                even though it's not perfect place but neither is the world right? As someone who has many internet friends, 
                I feel closer to people that live on the other side of the world than the people around me, simply 
                because we are more like minded. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Reflection: </strong> I don't know what I want to do after I graduate but right now I 
                have a retail job that I really love and can keep on doing until I do figure it out, and Amado 
                would totally agree that that's ok. Sometimes, doing what you love isn't something you can survive
                on, but if you can take care of the making money part, you can find the time to work on your passions
                and eventually be able to put all your time into it.

                <strong>Three Key Points: </strong>  
                <br> - Every design job is going to be completely different. I've had two marketing internships and one 
                had structure while the other tossed me into the wind. The creative world is a crazy place and 
                you can't really see what a job will bring into you're right in the middle of it. 
                <br> - Your past work might be embarassing, but it's something you can learn from. I volunteer for an
                online magazine and I hate the first couple issues I worked on, but I can see the growth between those 
                issues and the more recent ones. 
                <br> - If you want to do something, do it. This is really important because a really great project could
                die in your brain if you just leave it in there. My online store was only possible because I really
                really wanted to do it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Disagreements/Differences: </strong> Social media IS really weird, but it's also a good way to
                share art and find other artists. I follow a couple graphic designers on Instagram just because I love 
                looking at their work so much. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Prior Knowledge: </strong> I totally believe in just going for something. I have a lot of passion 
                for design work, and I feel satisfied trying for a design just to see what can come out of it, whether or 
                not it becomes successful in the end. You don't know what you can do unless you try. 
              </p>
