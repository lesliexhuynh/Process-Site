                <strong>Epiphanies/Insights: </strong> The Internet is really full of possibilies. Soda said Went to internet to find place where she belonged, 
                even though it's not perfect place but neither is the world right? As someone who has many internet friends, 
                I feel closer to people that live on the other side of the world than the people around me, simply 
                because we are more like minded. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Reflection: </strong> For my project, I am designing a brand. Instead of designing something that 
                is for a certain person or doing something that I think will evoke a specific reaction, I will design something
                that has meaning to me and is something that I love because this is my own personal brand based on my 
                own interests, and although I am trying to reach a similar audience, it's still supposed to represent me.

                <strong>Three Key Points: </strong>  <br> - A lot of the time, we only show people what we want them
                to see. An iconic part of Soda is her ability to blur the line between the "front stage" and "back stage". This is
                important because your online persona shouldn't be someone completely different than who you are in real life
                just because it's easy to make it look that way. 
                <br> - We project on each other and take in what we see about every person. We learn a lot just by observing
                and learning about people's interest and hobbies and anything that makes them them, because you 
                can learn something new and make it your own. <br> - It's easier to reach like minded people 
                thanks to the Internet. Being able to surround yourself with people who have something in common 
                with you is important because it makes you feel like you're a part of a whole while still being 
                your own individual. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Disagreements/Differences: </strong> Not a disagreement necessarily, but I wish she discussed haters more. She 
                kind acknoledges them for a second, but it's easy being a critic when you're annonymous.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Prior Knowledge: </strong> Soda mentions how the number of likes and comments warps the way we look
                at things. I recently deleted my entire Instagram feed because I was thinking about how it affects me and 
                the people around me. When I look at my photos, I think about what I had to do to get them. There's a photo of my 
                boyfriend and I that is really cute but I actually hate because I spent too much time trying to capture
                an Instagramable moment rather than enjoying the moment we were having. After deleting my feed, I no longer feel 
                a pressure of keeping my likes up.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Confusing Points: </strong> I hate how people disregarded Soda's work because they deemed it
                "too accessible". That's confusing to me because the whole point of the Internet is that it's accessible.
