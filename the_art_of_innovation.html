                <strong>Epiphanies/Insights: </strong> - Innovation is a lot of hard work. Kawasaki lists 10 key points (and a bonus 11th)
                and that basiclaly proves that it takes a lot in order to innovate and be successful. One of the things he 
                mentions at the end is bozos. The "dangerous" one is the one that looks expensive, because they have lived
                based on luck rather than smarts and you can only go on for so long like that.

                <strong>Reflection: </strong>  My project is going to focus on the branding of my company,
                but my company creates products as well. One key point that he discusses is that not everyone is 
                going to use your product as intended and you shouldn't be upset over that. That's when you learn how
                your product lives in the real world, in the hands of the consumer.

                <strong>Three Key Points: </strong> <br> - Great products are intelligent. I think this one is a big one
                because in order for a product to be successful, you need to understand not only the needs of the user, 
                but the needs they didn't even know they had. Being able to solve a problem they didn't know could be solved,
                something that is done in a day to day but somehow made even easier is how you make a great product.
                <br> - Don't Worry, Be Crappy. The only way you can get your product to improve is to get it out there. 
                Nothing is ever perfect, but you can get it there over hard work and time. Get your product to the best that 
                you can get, and then get it out there.
                <br> - Learn to pitch. You can have an amazing, groud breaking product, but if you can't convince people
                to buy it and have a good pitch, it's worthless. A really good piece of advice he had for this is to 
                customize the pitch. Relate to your audience so that they feel like they trust you and listen to you.

                <strong>Disagreements/Differences: </strong>  - I think jumping curves is a lot easier to say then to do.
                Even in his example, the ice business, it took 60 years to jump those curves. But I guess as long as 
              you try, that's what's important.

                <strong>Prior Knowledge: The example of Western Union dropping the ball by dismissing the telephone
                  reminds me in a different way of how Skype dropped the ball when the pandemic started. Skype is a known
                  brand and platform and they had the opportunity to grow so exponentially but they let Zoom come out of 
                  knowwhere and take over. Keeping an eye out for opportunities is very important.
