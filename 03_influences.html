                <strong> Paula Scher </strong> 

                <br> <strong> Part 1 </strong>
                <br> - She is a pretty influential graphic designer who has done notable logo design 
                work for clients such as Citi Bank, Shake Shack, New York Public Theater and CNN. 
                <br> - She is currently a partner at the New York office of Pentagram, an international design firm
                <br> - I couldn't find a resume but her biography is written out on the Pentagram website (<a href="https://www.pentagram.com/about/paula-scher">Biography</a>)
                <br> - Her logo design for The Public Theater won the coveted Beacon Award for integrated corporate design strategy.
                <br> - In 1998 she was named to the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame. 
                <br> - In 2000 she received the Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design. 
                <br> - She has served on the national board of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) and was president of its New York 
                Chapter from 1998 to 2000. In 2001 she was awarded the profession's highest honor, the AIGA Medal, in recognition
                 of her distinguished achievements and contributions to the field, and in 2006 she was awarded the Type Directors 
                 Club Medal, the first woman to receive the prize.
                 <br> - In 2012 she was honored with the Philadelphia Museum of Art's Design Collab Award
                 <br> - In 2013 she received the National Design Award for Communication Design, presented by the 
                 Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum
                 <br> - In 2019 she was named a SEGD Fellow.
                 <br> - In 2021 she was honored with the title Royal Designer for Industry (RDI). 
                 <br> - She is featured in “Abstract: The Art of Design,” the Netflix documentary series about leading figures in design and architecture.
                 <br> - Since Scher's work is mainly with design, such as typography, I don't think economic status is important because
                 there isn't much need for supplies for that kind of work. 

                 <br> <strong> Part 2 </strong>
                 <br> - Apple: Career Experience - This is an opportunity to work in a position temporarily (like a residency)
                 either at corporate or a retail store. 
                 <br> - Apple: Creative - This is a role at Apple retail stores to be able to teach customers how to be creative 
                 using Apple tools. 
                 <br> - 99Designs: Designer - As a designer, I have the opportunity to participate in design competitions.
                 <br> - All these roles relate to an aspect of my work of design,
